## A note on privacy

We don't collect any cookies or send any analytics or information to any server other than Coingecko API. Your IP is logged 

While it is unknown what they could do with the information you share (such as your IP), the API is only used to retrieve how much is 1 BTC in terms of USD. The amount of the conversion itself (eg: `300 usd`) is not sent to the Coingecko servers.

The same goes for the statistics that are logged on the btc2fiat.me server such as user agent and location.
